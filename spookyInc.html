					Spooky Inc was a Unity game I worked on for about 6 months alongside 8 other people. The stand-out feature of the game is the custom controller built by Edward Amatiello using an Arduino, and as part of the project I had to work very closely with them to make the controller communicates with the game correctly. I was also the most proficient programmer in the group, thus I became the lead programmer for the project and programming about 80% of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the game was workshopped by the whole group, I came up with the initial concept for the game and acted as a vison holder for the group. I’m very proud of the design and concept for the game, inspired by the frantic panic of tactical turn-based PvP games with short timers combined with real-time keeping track of NPCs inspired by FNAF, all with a spooky (not horror, Scooby Doo-style) coat of paint.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also picked up a lot of knowledge on how to work with other disciplines, as I was responsible for implementing much of the stuff made by my teammates, allowing me to pick up soft-knowledge on things like audio, animation and 3D modelling.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I did most of voice acting for the game in a small recording booth and it was extremely fun. After we finished I yelled into the microphone and completely shot my voice as a joke, I’ve got the audio clip here:
