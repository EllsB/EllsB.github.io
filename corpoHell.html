					Corporate Hells was a Unity VR game I worked on for about 12 months alongside 10 other people, 3 of those being other programmers. Prior to starting the project, I had used a VR headset a grand total of once, let alone programmed for it. It was tough understanding and working with it, but I dove into the deep end with the project and manged to learn a lot from it. My job on the project was being the classic the jack-of-all-trades I am most of the time, doing whatever needed to be done.
				</p>

					One of the things I’m most proud of from this project was being the lead animator on the project, just like with VR, throwing myself in at the deep end and learning as I went along. In my last group project Spooky Inc, I had worked alongside an actual animator, implementing their work into the project, so I had a basic knowledge on how Unity’s animation system worked. As a kid, there was also a time I wanted to do stop-motion animation, so I had a very basic knowledge of the 12 principles of animation. The animation isn’t extraordinary, but considering I was figuring it out as I went along, I am very happy with the result.

					I also made the trailer above in about a night just before the deadline for the project, and while it makes me cringe now, at the time I made it I was happy with it.
