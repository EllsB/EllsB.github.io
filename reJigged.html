					Re-Jigged is a 3d action-platformer where the player can use a mouse to move objects made in Unity that uses the 3D Game Kit Lite as a base. The story behind making it is a fun one. This game was made for a module on my course where the point was to make a game using another game/engine as a base, the point being to give us experience working within another game. I originally was making a game in UE5 using Lyra game as a base, however there was a major error that resulted in all my work getting deleted (even though I was using GitHub) and I spent too much time trying to fix it. With 10 days before the deadline, I decided to throw Hail Mary and make something completely different In Unity (my go-to engine). Re-Jigged was the result. Considering I only had 10 days to make it, I think it turned out well.

					The game itself was based loosely on how I used to play make-believe with action figures as a kid. I would decide what parts of the furniture my toys could stand on and what parts where lava or whatever. Often, I’d realise I made a gap too big or whatever and I’d have to re-arrange the platforms to make it so the toys could jump from place to place. I took this core idea and played around with it (as much as I could with the limited time) to come up with the puzzles for Re-Jigged.

					Also, please forgive the awful mic quality and voice on the video, the combination of a broken mic and pre-voice training isn’t a great combo.
